# Image Processing Zero to Hero

Welcome to the "Image Processing Zero to Hero" repository! This resource is dedicated to exploring a wide range of image processing techniques through 10 detailed Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook is self-contained and designed to guide you from basic concepts to advanced implementations in image processing, all using plain NumPy to ensure understanding and accessibility.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Image Enhancement** - Techniques to improve image quality.
2. **Fourier Transform** - Analyzing frequency components.
3. **Segmentation** - Partitioning images into multiple segments.
4. **Color Quantification** - Reducing the number of colors in an image.
5. **Template Matching** - Finding parts of an image that match a template.
6. **Filters** - Applying various filters to enhance/modify images.
7. **Corner and Edge Detection** - Detecting various features in images.
8. **Face Recognition** - Techniques to identify faces without using neural networks.
9. *Additional Topics* - Expanding on other relevant techniques.
10. *Advanced Applications* - Combining techniques for complex applications.

## Why This Approach?

In this repository, we focus on leveraging traditional image processing techniques which can be less resource-intensive compared to neural network approaches. This is particularly useful in scenarios where deploying large models is impractical due to resource constraints.
