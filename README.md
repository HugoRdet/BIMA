# Image Processing Zero to Hero

Welcome to the "Image Processing Zero to Hero" repository! This resource is dedicated to exploring a wide range of image processing techniques through 9 detailed Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook is self-contained and designed to guide you from basic concepts to advanced implementations in image processing, all using plain NumPy to ensure understanding and accessibility.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Image Enhancement** - Techniques to improve image quality.
2-3. **Fourier Transform** - Analyzing frequency components.
4. **Frequency filtering, color, template matching** 
5. **edge detection** - Reducing the number of colors in an image.
6. **Harris Corner Detector**
7. **Split and Merge, Segmentation** - Applying various filters to enhance/modify images.
8. **Color quantification and search by content** - Detecting various features in images.
9-10. **Face recognition by Eigenfaces method** - Techniques to identify faces without using neural networks.



## Why This Approach?

In this repository, we focus on leveraging traditional image processing techniques which can be less resource-intensive compared to neural network approaches. This is particularly useful in scenarios where deploying large models is impractical due to resource constraints.
